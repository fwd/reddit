# News Headlines Dataset

For research purposes. Available in JSON format. 

See **headlines.json** file for dataset. And **script.js** file for scraping script written in javascript.

**Sentiment**: Data includes sentiment score. We use a AFINN-165 wordlist and Emoji Sentiment Ranking to perform sentiment analysis on arbitrary blocks of input text. 

**Source:** Headlines are compiled from Reddit.com every 30 minutes. Please note, 'published' data point is when a headline was published on Reddit, not the article's website.
